# ML-Real-Life-Examples
Machine learning real life examples made by me. These include coding examples and explanations on the problems being addressed + the model results from the dataset.

   * [Problem 1](https://github.com/Achronus/ML-Real-Life-Examples/wiki/Regression#problem-1)
   This consists of a very simple dataset that has two columns: Years' Experience & Salary. We've been hired as a data scientist to find out the correlations between the Salary and Years' Experience.

   Using a simple linear regression we can find the best fit for an employee's salary depending on their years of experience.

   * [Problem 2](https://github.com/Achronus/ML-Real-Life-Examples/wiki/Regression#problem-2)
   This consists of a dataset with five columns: R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State & Profit. We've been hired as a data scientist by a venture capitalist fund company to analyse the dataset to provide them with information on which companies they would be most interested in investing in. Their main criteria is the profit.

   Using a small sample of their data, they want to determine where companies perform better based on the state they are in through the use of Marketing Spend, Administration or R&D Spend.

  Using a multiple linear regression we can help them to identify this.

   * [Problem 3](https://github.com/Achronus/ML-Real-Life-Examples/wiki/Regression#problem-3)
   We are a part of the human resources department in a large company and are looking to hire a new employee. We have found the ideal candidate and are considering making an offer to them. However, we are unsure on the appropriate salary for their position.

   The new employee has told us that he has 20+ years' experience and has earned over 160k salary in his previous company of employment and is asking for this as a starting wage. Doing research on the previous company we identified ten positions and the salary per position.

   Based on the position data we have, we have determined that they are around a level of 6.5 and want to be accurate with the salary. Looking at the data we can see that there is a non-linear relationship and we need to put a model together to determine the new employee's starting salary.

   In order to complete this problem we are going to experiment with four non-linear regression models: polynomial regression, SVR, decision tree regression and random forest regression.

* [Classification]()
   * [Problem 1]()
   We are hired as a data scientist for a social media business that has a client for a car company that wants to use their ad services to promote a new SUV. Our job is to create a model that identifies which users have bought the SUV through the social network.

   Based on the dataset provided, we are going to use the Age and Estimated Salary columns to help us with this problem.

   In order to solve this we are going to experiment with a range of classification models: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree Classification & Random Forest Classification.

* [Clustering]()
   * [Problem 1]()
   We have been hired as a machine learning specialist to work for a mall that has provided us with some of their customer's information to a membership card that they offer to customers to purchase products in different shops. The dataset provided consists of: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$) & Spending Score (1-100).

   Our job is to create a model that segregates the customers into respective groups based on their Annual Income & Spending Score.

   We are going to address this problem by using two models: K-Means Clustering & Hierarchical Clustering.

* [Dimensionality Reduction]()
   * [Problem 1]()
   A wine business owner has collated information related to types of wines they offer to customers. We have been hired as a data scientist to identify the best independent variables for each customer segment to determine which segment is suitable for each wine type.

   As the dataset is so large, we are going to the feature extraction models: LDA, PCA & Kernel PCA, to solve this issue.
